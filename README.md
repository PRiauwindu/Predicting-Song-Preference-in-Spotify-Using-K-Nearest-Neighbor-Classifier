# Predicting Song Preference in Spotify Using K-Nearest-Neighbor Classifier

GitHub Pages: 

This GitHub repository contains a project focused on building a K-Nearest-Neighbor (KNN) classifier model using the Spotify dataset in R. The goal of this project is to predict the song preferences of a hypothetical person named Putra, classifying them as either "like" or "dislike" based on their characteristics.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Spotify, a popular music streaming platform. It includes a wide range of features such as song duration, tempo, danceability, energy, and more. Each song in the dataset is labeled as either "like" or "dislike" based on Putra's preferences.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- The data directory contains the Spotify dataset in CSV format and any other necessary data files.
- The src directory contains the source code for the KNN classifier model (Predicting-Song-Preference-in-Spotify-Using-K-Nearest-Neighbor-Classifier.Rmd).
- The LICENSE file specifies the open-source license for this project.
- The README.md file provides detailed information about the project, including installation instructions, usage guidelines, and an overview of the repository's contents.

## Usage
To use this repository, follow these steps:
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Install the required dependencies mentioned in the requirements.txt file or the project's README.
- Open the R Markdown file (song_preference_prediction.Rmd) in the root directory.
- The R Markdown file contains the code for data preprocessing, model training, and testing.
- Run the R Markdown file to execute the code step by step.
- Review the results, including the trained model's performance and any predictions made.
